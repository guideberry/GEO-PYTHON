What is JupyterLab?

JupyterLab is a website designed to help you code faster better stronger. It puts all the tools you need into one workspace. It's relatively new and is the next generation of Jupyter Notebooks, a software package used by many to create and document computer programs and scientific projects.

Jupyter notebooks are so popular, many tutorials are writting in that format. Our core tutorial, GeoPython 2020, has lessons designed to be done in JupyterLab. The GeoPython 2020 tutorial stores it's lesson files in GitHub. Each time we open JupyterLab, we will get our previous code and the GeoPython 2020 course materials from GitHub. When we are done creating in Jupyter we will save our code to GitHub.
