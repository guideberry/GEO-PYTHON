# JupyterLab

## How we use it
GEO-PYTHON's lessons are designed to be done in JupyterLab and a link to JupyterLab is provided at the start of each lesson. 

## What it is
JupyterLab is the next generation of Jupyter Notebooks, a a teaching tool used to create and document computer programs and scientific projects. Jupyter notebooks are very popular, many tutorials are written in the notebook format. 

## What is does
JupyterLab puts notebooks and other tools you need into one workspace. JupyterLab contains a code Editor, document editor, file explorer, command line interface, and more. You can write and test your code, take notes, and execute terminal commands all from within JupyterLab. It even acts as a local git repository, so you don't have to download git to your computer.

## Benefits of learning
Understanding how to use JupyterLab effectively will reduce the time it takes to complete tasks, and increase your skills. PLus, you will have access to libraries of tutorials written in the Jupyter notebook format.
