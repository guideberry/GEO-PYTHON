# What is the GeoPython Tutorial?


## Overview
GEO-PYTHON is a free online course, in english, designed for Python beginners, sponsored by the University of Helsinki. 

The GEO-PYTHON course teaches students  basic Python, Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib), data analysis, and plotting techiques.  There are 7 lessons that progressively teach you to analyze, munge, and display raw weather data. It's the first of three courses. Geo-Python covers the necessary skills needed before continuing to the more advanced courses Automating GIS processes and/or Introduction to Quantitative Geology. 

## Duration
This is intended to be a 7 week course. The lesson lengths and difficulty vary. Each lesson may take a few hours to a few days to complete. 


 
## Course Materials 

**GeoPython**  website is the course book,  
**JupyterLab** is the code development environment,  
**GitHub** hosts your code and the course materials.

All of this will be explained in the course and additional resources will be listed. 
## How to use the GeoPython tutorial:
Hels hath two parts that are nearly identical. The website, and the GitHub repository. The difference is... **the lessons in the website have code examples that you can use to solve your exercises**. The GitHub repository only has the instructions, error tests, and data. GeoPython's GitHub repository is basically a template for you to fill in the blanks.

## Unfortunately 
There are no solutions provided for the exercises at the end of the lessons. There are hints, and the exercises are often a combination of the examples. But there are a few parts where you may need some help. That's where this guide may be useful. :)
