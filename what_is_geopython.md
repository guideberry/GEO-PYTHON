# What is the GeoPython Tutorial?


The Geopython tutorial has all the info you need, so don't feel obligated to come back here if you're grooving.

On the other hand, if you'd like more prep, or get stuck on an exercise... we'll be here.

## So what is GeoPython?
It's a free online course, in english, designed for Python beginners, sponsored by the University of Helsinki. The first course teaches you enough Python to use the Python libraries that have fun names like Pandas and Matplotlib. Libraries are groups of prewritten code that you can use like a tool box. You'll use Python and it's libraries to get real world data from reputable sources, like NOAA. Then you'll learn to turn it into pretty plots that you can put on your resume.

Since it's the university of Helsinki... and we are very thankful for the knowledge, we honor them by occasionally refering to the tuts as Hels, Hels2, and HelsNo.

## How to use the GeoPython tutorial:
Hels hath two parts that are nearly identical. The website, and the GitHub repository. The difference is... **the lessons in the website have code examples that you can use to solve your exercises**. The GitHub repository only has the insructions and data. GeoPython's GitHub repository is a template for you to fill in the blanks.

## Unfortunately 
There are no solutions provided for the exercises at the end of the lessons. There are hints, and the exercises are often a combination of the examples. But there are a few parts where you may need some help. That's where this guide may be useful. :)
