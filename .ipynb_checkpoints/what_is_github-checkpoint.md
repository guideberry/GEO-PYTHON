# WHAT IS GIT HUB?

Github is amazing! But you wouldn't know that by looking at it. It looks alot like a concrete wall. You can definitely hurt your head trying to use it without guidance.

You will access course materials and store your code examples and completed exercises for free on GitHub  
### Safe Available Storage:
You're gonna write a lot of code in your learning journey. Some projects will take days or weeks. You'll build tools that can be reused for years. You'll want a safe place to store all your files with easy access from anywhere. 

### Code Sharing:
You might want to share your code with collegues. But most of all, you'll want to access all those free code examples from excellent sources, all of whom use github to make sharing easy  

### Code Versioning:
You can change your code fearlessly, knowing you can go back to any point in time when your code was working.

### Code Collaboration:
Git allow multiple people to work on the same project, at the same time, from diffrent places. Git keeps track of who changed what and when. Git will also tell you if changes from different people will collide.

### Multiple Development Environments (and the winner is...)
You can have as many copies of your projects as you like. Want to see if a change will work... make a copy and try it there. If it works, Git will merge it into your project. If it doesn't work, no big deal... it's just a copy and copies are ... free.

### HOW WE USE GITHUB:
We'll use github to download and store the lessons and data we need to complete our projects and to save our code. 

When we're ready to work on our projects, we'll get our code and materials from GitHub and load them into JupyterLab.

We'll save to GitHub after each advancement in our code and when we're done.
