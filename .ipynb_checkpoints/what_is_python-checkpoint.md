# What is Python?

Hello! Welcome! and Congratulations!  
You can you can do this! If you are reading this sentence on a device attached to the internet, then you have all the skills needed to get started. If you came here with no other skills than those, you can gain all the information you need along the way.

Python
------  
Like English, Python is a language. It's a much smaller language than english and only takes a few minutes to get started writing code. Let's compare how the two languages communicate the same action.  

English:   
```Print the words "Hello" on the computer screen.``` 
  
Python:  
```print('Hello')```

You could make the arguement that python is considerably easier than english.

### So why does is seem so hard? 
Well some parts are hard but mostly it's because it's so different from what we're used to seeing. Some of the concepts are made-up specifically to adapt to the computer's world. They're not part of our everyday experience. The sun doesn't set in the Python world, but there are other things you can count on... like... tuples being immutable.  

Hey! Where're you going? They're just words. Relax, no one expects you to remember everything, or understand all the concepts at first sight. Actually, they know you won't. That's why hints, cheat sheets, and examples are built into the system.

Like a good friend, the Python environment  will literally help you finish a sentence if you know how to ask. (tab or shift + tab) Also... you might not believe this but internet searches are often useful for finding ways to code around a particular problem.

There are helpful reminders built into the Python environment, cheat sheets with pretty colors, well organized and friendly tutorials... it's almost like they want you to succeed. 

And best of all, Python is fun! You can create interesting projects, solve puzzles, have little minions running around in the cloud doing your bidding. (Literally doing your bidding if you use the Ebay api).

But you're already motivated aren't you? It's the 92,000 avg salary for Python developers isn't it?
